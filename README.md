# UFOs
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to create a webpage that would provide information on UFO sightings based on the filters that the user inputs. 

## Results
We were able to successfully implement a robust filter based on the different categories such as date, city, state, country and shape. When the user inputs their desired filter condition into the filter category, they will receive the corresponding rows based on the data.js file that was provided.

## Summary

While we do have a robust filter on the webpage, I believe that we are limited by the data.js file. Since it's a file with limited numbers of entries, in order to increase sighting data we would have to input it manually into the data.js file. One recommendation that I have would be to connect our app to a database that would store these entries and can be easily added to. Perhaps to aid in this, we could create a section of the website that would allow for users to easily enter sighting data that would be recorded in our database.
